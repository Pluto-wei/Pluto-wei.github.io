# Biography

Yu-Wei Zhuo（卓雨薇）is a senior student majoring in Computer Science and Technology in [Yingcai Honors College (英才实验学院)](https://www.yingcai.uestc.edu.cn/), [UESTC (电子科技大学)](https://www.uestc.edu.cn/), supervised by [Prof. Liang-Jian Deng](https://liangjiandeng.github.io/). I' m broadly interested in computer vision and deep learning. My current research focuses on remote sensing pansharpening, image fusion and deep learning. I will pursue my Ph.D. degree in [Department of Electronic Engineering,Tsinghua University（电子工程系）](https://www.ee.tsinghua.edu.cn/), [Tsinghua University (清华大学)](https://www.tsinghua.edu.cn/).
